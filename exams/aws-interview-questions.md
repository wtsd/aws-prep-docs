# ðŸ’¼ AWS Interview Prep â€“ Q&A

## Beginner Level

**Q1: How would you explain AWS to a non-technical manager?**  
**A:** AWS is like renting IT resources instead of buying hardware. You only pay for what you use, scale instantly, and rely on AWS for reliability and security.  
Example: Instead of buying servers, a startup can launch a website in minutes on AWS.

**Q2: How would you secure an S3 bucket containing sensitive customer data?**  
**A:**  
- Block public access.  
- Apply least-privilege IAM policies.  
- Encrypt objects (SSE-KMS).  
- Enable CloudTrail to log access.  
- Use Macie to scan for PII.  
ðŸ‘‰ This demonstrates knowledge of security best practices.

## Intermediate Level

**Q3: What are the main components of a Well-Architected Framework?**  
**A:** 5 Pillars:  
1. **Operational Excellence** â€“ automate, monitor, improve.  
2. **Security** â€“ IAM, encryption, compliance.  
3. **Reliability** â€“ fault tolerance, recovery.  
4. **Performance Efficiency** â€“ right resources, elasticity.  
5. **Cost Optimization** â€“ reduce waste, choose pricing models.

**Q4: Explain how IAM roles differ from IAM users.**  
**A:**  
- **User:** Long-term identity (username + password/keys).  
- **Role:** Temporary access assumed by users/apps. Roles donâ€™t have long-term credentials.  
ðŸ‘‰ Roles are more secure (used in EC2, Lambda, EKS via IRSA).

**Q5: How would you migrate a traditional application to AWS?**  
**A:** Steps:  
1. **Assess** â€“ use Migration Hub, TCO calculator.  
2. **Plan** â€“ choose strategy (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor).  
3. **Migrate** â€“ use tools like DMS (databases), Snowball (bulk data).  
4. **Optimize** â€“ scale, add monitoring, security.  
ðŸ‘‰ Shows understanding of CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework).

## Advanced Level (Scenario-based)

**Q6: Your EC2 instance is compromised. What do you do?**  
**A:**  
1. Isolate instance (security group, NACL).  
2. Snapshot disk for forensics.  
3. Check CloudTrail logs for access history.  
4. Rotate IAM credentials.  
5. Patch vulnerability and redeploy.  
ðŸ‘‰ Demonstrates incident response workflow.

**Q7: Design a scalable web app on AWS.**  
**A:**  
- **Frontend:** CloudFront + S3 static hosting.  
- **Backend:** ALB â†’ EC2 Auto Scaling group or Lambda.  
- **DB:** RDS Multi-AZ or DynamoDB.  
- **Networking:** VPC with public/private subnets.  
- **Security:** WAF + Shield + IAM roles.  
- **Observability:** CloudWatch, X-Ray, Config.  
ðŸ‘‰ This covers performance, reliability, and security pillars.

---

**Q8: How do you connect on-premises data center to AWS?**  
**A:** Options:  
- **VPN (IPSec)** â€“ quick, over Internet.  
- **Direct Connect** â€“ dedicated private line, low latency.  
- **Transit Gateway** â€“ hub for multiple VPCs + on-prem.  
ðŸ‘‰ Common interview scenario question.
